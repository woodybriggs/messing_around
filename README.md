# Messing_Around
This repository is a collection of random programs and scripts that I write and share for fun.

# rhythmbox-print-playing.py
An Ubuntu python script that I run on (Ctrl+Home) press to notify me what song/radio I'm listening to
Script uses subprocess to call

  - rhythmbox-client --print-playing

Mapped to keyboard through Ubuntu's Keyboard settings -> Custom Shortcuts
